/* Dynamic Programming
DP is used for inhanced our program or better for optimization. Before knowing Dp, we know some graph, recursion concept.
to become more easy to understand Dynamic Programming.

There are 2 main types of DP
1. Top-Down approach (Memoization)
2. Bottom-Up approach (Tabulation)
we store result in table (array, matrix, variable) or object. depends on which progamming language.

1. Memoization
-> Break problems at the top.
-> Recursive -> with table to store result.

2. Tabulation
-> consider smallest problem first.
-> solution are typically build iteratively and are stored in a table (array)
